# PRODIGY_WD_01LandingPage

This project features a modern, responsive navigation menu built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a brand logo and a neatly structured navigation bar with links to sections like Home, About, Services, and Contact. The menu is designed to be fully responsive, making it user-friendly across devices. The interface is enhanced with interactive scroll effects and styling transitions, giving it a smooth, professional look. This project helped me practice responsive web design, sticky navigation behavior, and basic animation effects, demonstrating my ability to create clean and user-friendly UI components.
